In my weaponHandler there is a switch case and functions that should switch with using a if statement.


I created a IShoot script becuase all weapons can shoot and fire.

A weapon script where all the basic function are defined so that they can be reused.

every weapon inherit from the weapon script and override the Fire function because every weapon has a different way of shooting.

made a ammo script that the weapons make use of and inherit the reload script.

and a reload script because not all weapons can reload.
